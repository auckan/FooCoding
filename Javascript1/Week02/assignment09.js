//How to use modulus operator
let x5 = 7;
x5 = x5 % 3;
console.log("The new value of my variable x5 is: 1 ");
console.log(x5);
console.log("x5 = x5 % 5 will be 2");
console.log("x5 = x5 % 4 will be 3");
console.log(
  "Modulus operator (%) returns the remainder left over when one operand is divided by secons operand. "
);
console.log(
  "In this case, when we divide 7 by 3, we obtained 1 as left over.  "
);
console.log("This can be use to determine if a number even or odd.  ");
